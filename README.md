## Spatial Statistical Methods for Spatial Proteomics Data

This repository contains rmarkdown files which explore open-source R packages, integrate methods from those packages, and reproduce published spatial proteomics data analysis

### Background


### Goals
To characterize tumor-immune microenvironment in triple negative breast cancer patients from _Keren et al (2018)_

- Aim 1: Visualize cell type distribution in space domain
- Aim 2: Explore protein abundance and heterogeneity across cell types
- Aim 3: Characterize tumor-immune microenvironment using spatial intensity of cell types and dimensionality reduction method
